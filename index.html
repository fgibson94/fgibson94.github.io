                    You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! Burn her anyway!

                    Well, she turned me into a newt. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! __I fart in your general direction!__ *Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!* Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!
                    Now, look here, my good man. But you are dressed as one… What do you mean? I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!
